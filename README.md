# Fake-App-Page-Sketches

This project contains the page designs for a fake web application as well as the business requirements and feature descriptions of said pages.

These were crated by myself and a classmate using figma.com. A free-to-use design website for creating templates such as these. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

These were made for an assignment where the goal was to create the early templates of an application that would be used in some relation to Urban Sprawl.
The idea was to create an app used by construction companies or urban planners to help choose locations and areas that would be ideal for urban growth and development.
